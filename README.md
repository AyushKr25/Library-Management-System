# Library-Management-System
The Library Management System (LMS) is a comprehensive Java-based application designed to streamline and automate the daily operations of a library. In traditional library setups, managing books, user records, and borrowing activities often becomes time-consuming and prone to errors when handled manually. This project was developed to overcome such inefficiencies by creating a structured and automated system that can efficiently manage users, books, and transactions in real time.

The main goal of the Library Management System is to create a platform where both library administrators and users can interact seamlessly. Users can browse, borrow, return, and search for books, while administrators can manage the collection by adding or updating book details. The system provides an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using Java Swing, which makes it user-friendly and easy to navigate even for beginners. This interface ensures that users can perform various tasks without needing to understand the technical details of database management or backend operations.

The application follows the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology, a modern approach where tests are written before the actual code implementation. This ensures that each component of the system is tested thoroughly during development, leading to a robust and error-free application. The TDD approach not only improves software quality but also enhances maintainability by allowing developers to modify or extend the system without fear of breaking existing functionality. All test cases are handled through JUnit, a popular testing framework in Java, ensuring systematic verification of features like user registration, login, adding books, borrowing, returning, and searching.

The system’s backend is powered by MySQL, which serves as a reliable database to store all the information related to users, books, and borrowing history. The database ensures data integrity and supports operations such as adding new records, retrieving details, and updating book availability. The connection between the Java application and the database is established using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), allowing smooth communication and real-time updates.

One of the strengths of this project is its clear distinction between user and admin roles. Regular users have limited access to functionalities such as viewing, searching, borrowing, and returning books, while the admin has special privileges, including adding new books to the database and managing the inventory. This role-based access control ensures data security and prevents unauthorized modifications to critical information.

Moreover, the system’s design emphasizes modularity and scalability. Each module (User Management, Book Management, and Borrow-Return Management) is developed as an independent component, making the system easy to maintain and expand. For example, in future versions, additional features such as fine calculation for late returns, book reservation, or digital library integration could be easily implemented.

Overall, the Library Management System provides a modern solution to the challenges faced by traditional libraries. By combining Java programming, MySQL database management, GUI-based interfaces, and the TDD development methodology, the project ensures efficiency, accuracy, and reliability. It not only simplifies library operations but also serves as a learning model for software engineering practices, database integration, and test-driven software development.
